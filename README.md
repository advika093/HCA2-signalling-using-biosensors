# HCA2-signalling-using-biosensors


This repository contains the documentation for assessing the signaling of the HCA2 (Hydroxycarboxylic Acid 2) receptor using genetically-encoded biosensors. The project aims to investigate the cellular responses to HCA2 activation through the implementation of biosensors that provide real-time monitoring of signaling events.

## Features

- Genetically-encoded Biosensors: Utilizes genetically-encoded biosensors to measure HCA2 signaling.
- Real-time Monitoring: Provides real-time monitoring of cellular responses to HCA2 activation.
- Data Analysis: Includes graphs for assessing biosensor data using GraphPad Prism Software (https://www.graphpad.com/)
## Methods
- Plasmid Construction: 
A plasmid consisting the untagged human HCA2 receptor was engineered via the AQUA cloning method. Linear DNA for the HCA2 receptor was obtained and amplified, followed by gel extraction and transformation into E. coli cells. Colonies were screened, and the construct was verified through restriction digest and DNA sequencing.
- Cell Culture:
HEK293T cells were cultured and maintained under specific conditions. Passaging was performed routinely, and detached cells were used for further experiments.
- Transfection: 
HEK293Τ cells were transiently transfected with plasmids using polyethylenimine (PEI) and sodium chloride. Successful transfection was confirmed through fluorescence visualization and cell counting.
- Bystander BRET β-Arrestin Assay: 
A biosensor plasmid containing NanoLuc-β-arrestin 2 and Lyn11-mNeonGreen was used for this assay. Human HCA2 and FFA4 receptors served as controls. Luminescent emissions were measured, and compounds were introduced to assess the BRET ratio, fold change, and Net BRET.
- TRUPATH G Protein Assay:
The TRUPATH assay involved studying two Gαi proteins. A biosensor with receptor, Gβ3, Gγ8-GFP2, and Gαi1-RLuc8 or Gαi2-RLuc8 was utilized. Luminescent emission was measured before and after drug introduction, calculating the ratio of BRET values for data analysis.
- Data Analysis:
Data analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism software. Concentration-response curves were fitted using nonlinear regression analysis to determine EC50 values. Results are presented as mean ± SEM from at least two independent experiments.
